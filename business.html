                A summary of three digital projects I’ve been involved in, highlighting my role,
                the problem addressed, and the outcomes – including the design concept behind the Problem-Solving Page
                for the restaurant’s digital transformation.

            <!-- PROJECT 1 -->
            <article class="project-card">
                <h2>Project 1: Restaurant Digital Transformation Website</h2>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Chief Technology Officer (CTO) – Local Restaurant (Project Role)</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The restaurant lacked a clear online presence, making it difficult for customers to
                    find information, view the menu, and understand how to contact or visit the venue.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Planned and developed a multi-page, responsive website focused on:
                    a professional Home page, a clear Skills/CTO profile, a business-focused showcase, a Problem-Solving
                    support page, and a dedicated Contact page. This structure supports the restaurant’s digital brand,
                    gives customers a trusted first impression, and creates a foundation for future online bookings and promotions.</p>

            <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
            <article class="project-card">
                <h2>Project 2: Online Booking & Menu Explorer (Course Assignment)</h2>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Web Developer – Group Assignment</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Many small hospitality venues struggle to present menus and handle bookings
                    without relying on third-party platforms that can be confusing or expensive.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Contributed to the design and build of a simple web prototype where users could:
                    browse a structured menu, check basic availability, and submit a booking request online.
                    My focus was on clean page layout, logical navigation, and making sure the booking form captured
                    the key information staff would need (date, time, party size, contact details) in a user-friendly way.</p>

            <!-- PROJECT 3: PROBLEM-SOLVING PAGE CONCEPT -->
            <article class="project-card">
                <h2>Project 3: Problem-Solving Page – Support & Contact Hub</h2>
                <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX & Front-End Designer / CTO (Project Role)</p>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The restaurant needed a central place for customers to ask questions, give feedback,
                    and connect via social media. Existing channels were scattered, which risked missed messages and a poor customer experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Designed the Problem-Solving Page as a dedicated “help and contact” hub that:
                    integrates social media links, clearly displays contact details, and includes an interactive form
                    that generates email content from user inputs. This makes it easier for customers to communicate
                    clearly and helps the restaurant respond more efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Design Concept for the Problem-Solving Page</h3>
                <ul class="simple-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Structured layout:</strong> The page is divided into clear sections: an introduction at the top,
                        a block for contact details, a section for social media links, and an interactive form.
                        This helps customers quickly see the options and choose how they want to reach out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contact details first:</strong> Key information (address, phone number, business email,
                        and opening hours) is grouped together in a card-style layout so customers can quickly find
                        practical details without scrolling through the whole page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Social media integration:</strong> Social icons/links (e.g. Instagram, Facebook, X)
                        are grouped under a “Connect with us” heading. This supports the restaurant’s digital brand
                        and encourages ongoing engagement beyond a single visit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interactive email form:</strong> The form collects the customer’s name, email address,
                        enquiry type, and message. JavaScript is used to generate a clear email-style summary
                        (subject line + body) based on the inputs, helping customers send structured information that’s
                        easier for staff to respond to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User-friendly and accessible:</strong> Labels, placeholder text, and basic validation
                        are planned to make the form easy to use on both mobile and desktop. The design supports
                        different user goals – from booking questions to feedback and complaints – without overwhelming them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
